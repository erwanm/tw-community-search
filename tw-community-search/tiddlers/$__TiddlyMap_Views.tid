You can use the name of a view to embed graphs in your tiddlers. Just look at the many [[Examples]] provided in this wiki. All changes are instantly reflected in each graph that uses the view.

Use the [[widget generator|Embedding views within tiddlers]] to create a code similar to the one below.

```html
<$tiddlymap view="Default" height="300px"></$tiddlymap>
```

!!! Node view and edge-type views

The node view and the edge-type view (also called node filter and edge-type filter respectively) are the two components that make up the graph view. Node views allow you to filter the nodes displayed in the graph, while edge-type views let you decide, which particular edge types to display in the graph. See [[Node and edge-type filters]].
