#; [[TW5-TiddlyMap|$:/plugins/felixhayashi/tiddlymap]]
#: This is the core TiddlyMap plugin.
#; [[TW5-Vis.js|$:/plugins/felixhayashi/vis]]
#: This plugin will install vis.js which is required for the graph's rendering.
#; [[TW5-HotZone|$:/plugins/felixhayashi/hotzone]]
#: This plugin is necessary when you want to use the //live view//.
#; [[TW5-TopStoryView|$:/plugins/felixhayashi/topstoryview]]
#: Unless you are using the //zoomin// or //stacked// story view, install this plugin to achieve a better live view experience.
# Maybe you also want to install [[Font Awesome for TiddlyWiki]]
# Save your TiddlyWiki.
# Refresh the window.
# Click on the Map tab in your wiki's sidebar.
# Read and confirm the welcome dialog (appears only when installed for the first time).
