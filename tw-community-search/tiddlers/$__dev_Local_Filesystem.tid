Both of those lines work for me. There are a couple things to be careful of here.

```
<iframe src="file:///f:/reboot.txt" frameborder=0 width="100%" height="700"></iframe>`
```

```
<object width="100%" height="900" type="application/pdf" data="file:\\E:\binder.pdf #toolbar=0&amp;navpanes=0&amp;statusbar=0">
</object>
```

The following causes a small window to pop up which tells me that "You have chosen to open: daily.xls which is: Microsoft Office Excel 97-2003 from c:/backup." and asks if I want to open it with Microsoft Office Excel.

```
<a href="file:///c:/backup/daily.xls">View xls</a>
```
