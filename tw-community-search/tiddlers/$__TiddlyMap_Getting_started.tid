Hi, this is a demo site of TiddlyMap.

See the [[version history|Version History]] for a list of existing features and [[overview|The Big Picture]] to understand what TiddlyMap can do for you. To dive into the basic concepts and building blocks of TiddlyMap check out the [[docs|Documentation]]. Use the double-click on the nodes to [[navigate|Navigation]] to the corresponding content. The visualization runs most smoothly in [[Chrome|http://www.google.com/chrome/]]. Many [[thanks|Special thanks]] to everybody who made this project possible.

TiddlyMap is currently in its late beta-phase. If you want to use it in your wiki, check out the [[installation instructions|Installation]].
