Hi, this is a demo site of TiddlyMap.

See the [[version history|Version History]] for a list of existing features and check out the [[docs|Documentation]] to understand what TiddlyMap can do for you. Use the double-click on the nodes to [[navigate|Navigation]] to the corresponding content. The visualization runs most smoothly in [[Chrome|http://www.google.com/chrome/]]. TiddlyMap is designed to be used on large desktop screens. Here is an impression how it should look like: [[Screenshot|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/TiddlyMap_Demo_Site_-_0.7.24.png]].

TiddlyMap is currently in its late beta-phase. If you want to use it in your wiki, check out the [[installation instructions|Installation]]. Many [[thanks|Special Thanks]] to everybody who made this project possible.
