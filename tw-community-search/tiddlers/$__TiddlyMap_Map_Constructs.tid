Constructs or concepts form the vocabulary of a domain. They constitute a conceptualization used to describe problems within the domain and to specify their solutions.

Map constructs may be understood as the conceptual building blocks of TiddlyMap. The following constructs exist:

<style>
#construct-table-wrapper table th { width: 200px; }
</style>

<div id="construct-table-wrapper">

| !|[[Views]] are rules that determine which nodes and edges are displayed in a graph |
| !Nodes|Representations of tiddlers in a graph |
| !Edges|Connect nodes with each other |
| !Edge Types|[[Edge types]] are the blueprint for edge instances |
| !Node Types|[[Node types]] are the blueprint for node instances |
| !Edge-Type Namespaces|Define the contexts of edge-types |

</div>

An important question related to these constructs is, which data structure to employ for storage and retrival of construct instances. This includes for example the [[Storage of Edges]].
