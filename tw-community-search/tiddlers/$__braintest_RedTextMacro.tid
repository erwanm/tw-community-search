This is a single macro to put any text in red color.

Usage:

```
<<rojo "text to put in red color">>.This is not in red color
```

<<rojo "text to put in red color">>. This is not in red color.

The macro name is rojo instead of red for two reasons: 
* Spanish is my native languaje.
* red is a very common word in english, so I choosed rojo to avoid possible collisions.

If you want this macro just grab this link to your TW5:

''Note that after installing this macro you have to reload the browser in order to make it work.'' This is because the core have to load the javascript code.

Special thanks to ''StephanHradek'' to make the basic javascript macro example. ( [[TW5Magick|http://tw5magick.tiddlyspot.com/]] )
