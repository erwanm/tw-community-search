As of v0.9.3 TiddlyMap tries to automatically configure your wiki for optimal use with TiddlyWiki. However, some further suggestions are listed here.

!! Choosing a suitable TiddlyWiki story view

Needed by the [[Live view]]. Also see [[Live mode plugin dependencies]].

# Open the [[TiddlyWiki control panel]]
# select "Appearance"
# select "Story View"
# choose `Top` or `Zoomin`

!! Setting the Tiddler Opening Behaviour

Needed by the [[Live view]] to function correctly.

# Open the [[TiddlyWiki control panel]]
# select "Settings"
# select "Tiddler Opening Behaviour"
# choose
#* `Open above the current tiddler`
#* __and__ `Open at the top of the story river`

!! Display tiddler titles as links:

Useful when working with the [[Live view]] as clicking on the title moves it into focus.

# Open the [[TiddlyWiki control panel]]
# select "Settings"
# select "Tiddler Titles"
# choose "Display tiddler titles as links"

!! Settin the default sidebar tab

In case you want to have TiddlyMap immediately displayed at startup.
