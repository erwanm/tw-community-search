While writing a macro for my plugin I used all the techniques described in the thread:

!! Browser
* `alert('foo')`
** perhaps better: `if(!confirm('foo')) return;`
* `<<dumpvariables>>`
* `F12`
* `debugger`<div>

# add in js where you want a breakpoint for the dev tools<div>

```
var foo = 1;
// break here to be able to step into bar()
debugger
bar(foo);
```
</div>
# open dev tools / F12
# open the wiki or reload / F5, trigger the code
# the debugger should stop at your breakpoint
#* from there you can step into your code, inspect variables, see the Javascript console for errors, etc.
</div>

!! Node
* `console.log`
* node error reporting
