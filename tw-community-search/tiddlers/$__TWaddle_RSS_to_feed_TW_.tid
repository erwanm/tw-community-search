Might RSS serve as a way for TW to aggregate content from non-tw sources and tiddlify it? And tw sources for that matter. It is a mature technology that is made both for publishing and aggregating content. And it has [[many uses|http://www.social-searcher.com/2015/02/10/30-awesome-ways-for-using-rss-feeds/]] - note the headlines showing just above the numbered headlines there. The side is about //ways// to use RSS, not the particular examples.

I - who admittedly know zipf on the subject - am thinking that if the aggregator itself is written in javascript and the output from it is in html form... then it should be possible to get it going in TW, no? But then there are browser restrictions.  

...but, in spite of such restrictions, I find these aggregators that let you mangle the output and style it etc... so... can't we "put a TW around it"? (Ah, there I made you smile or is that a roll of the eyes? Hey, somebody has to dare ask the stupid questions and I perform this task very well, thank you.)

Anyway, if I understand it right, a RSS/Atom aggregator/reader is "merely" a parser so //if// the feed can get into the TW then it "should work". Here is some stuff of possible use:
