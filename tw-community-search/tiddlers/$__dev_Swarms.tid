; tiddler
: the fundamental unit of information in TiddlyWiki

; plugin
: a bundle of tiddlers packaged together as a single tiddler
: distribute optional, custom components

; swarm
: //"I have come to think of the mechanism that yields plugins as a more general concept of bundling tiddlers to be reused and repurposed for different usecases, like a bundle or a "swarm of tiddlers"... rushing from one place to another."// â€” Tobias Beer

: rules are defined in a policy
