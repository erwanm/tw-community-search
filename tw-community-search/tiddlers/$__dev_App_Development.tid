Say, one develops a number of plugins intended to support a tw5 based application.

What would you recommend for...

# The bundling process...
#* Split components into an app-core and perhaps optional plugins?
#* I guess the reliable way is to always build against the stable release
# Providing upgrade paths...
#* Can't stop users from upgrading TiddlyWiki independently, right?
#* Would app-packages be dragged to the app, replacing an existing package?
#* What is required for an "upgrader"?
#* Can there be master packages, i.e. plugin-plugins
#** ...thus allowing distros, e.g. basic, full, ...?
