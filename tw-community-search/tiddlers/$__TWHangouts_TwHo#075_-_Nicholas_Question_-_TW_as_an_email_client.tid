 Better integration with email would be very useful - Jeremy saw this as an imap protocol implementation into ~TiddlyWiki - From Mario eamil.js link - Email in pure javascript imap client but not imap server - being an imap client opens up possiblities as Nick is imagining - How would we do it? Write a library and there are existing libraries we could take advantage of - Store Tiddlers on an imap server - Idea could work - We are interested in email integration - Eating our own dogfood Google Group - Jeremy uses email to answer things and therefore having integration would allow this - [[IFTTT|https://ifttt.com/]] - If This Then That - Creating workflows using this would get us a lot of flexibility - Resounding Yes on using TW as an email client
