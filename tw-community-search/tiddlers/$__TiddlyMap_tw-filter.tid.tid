The idea behind this magic edge-type namespace is that you do not statically define to which tiddlers a tiddler is connected to, like you would normally do when creating an edge, but instead you use [[TiddlyWiki filters]] to define the targets of the edge.

! Example

Say you want to connect the tiddler "Me" with all tiddlers that have the relationship "is friend". Normally, you would create a link to each tiddler, using the [[TiddlyMap Toolbar Button]] or by drawing the edges in the [[Sidebar map editor]].

With the `tw-filter` edge-type namespace you could instead do the following (this simple example assumes that you tagged all tiddlers with "friends"):

# Create the edge-type `tw-filter:friend` in the [[Edge-type manager]].
# create a field `friend` in the tiddler "Me" and enter the following filter expression: `[tag[Friend]]`.
# Now if "Me" is automatically linked with all tiddlers that have a field `Friend`. Also if new tiddlers with this tag are added, they will be connected to "Me" automatically!
