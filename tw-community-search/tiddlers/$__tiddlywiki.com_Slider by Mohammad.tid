A trail can be used to create a sequence of selected contents like step by step tutorial, guided help, lessons and similar.

The slider plugin user interface contains three sections

* A sidebar tab called Trails to manage trails
* A dashboard for each trail (where trail structure is managed)
* Tiddlers in a trail, also called slides
