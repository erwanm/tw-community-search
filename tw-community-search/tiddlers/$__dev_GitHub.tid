!!Working With Git
checking status and making sure things are clean

`git status`

get updates from upstream master

`git fetch upstream`

also uses tags? => fetch

`git fetch upstream --tags`

check out master and merge updates

`git checkout master`<br>
`git merge upstream/master`

working on features => create branch

`git checkout -b new-feature-branch`

some work done, some commits happen, some time passes...

getting stuff from master up to date...

`git fetch upstream`<br>
`git rebase upstream/master`

getting it up in my repo

`git add .`
`git commit -m "here a concise commit message" `
`git push origin new-feature-branch`

needs more polishing, changes happen on upstream?<br>

rebase local branch on top of the updates from upstream...<br>

`git fetch upstream`<br>
`git rebase upstream/master`

force push onto your remote branch....

`git push -f origin new-feature-branch`
