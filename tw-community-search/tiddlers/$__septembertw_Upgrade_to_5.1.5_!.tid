(Belatedly) upgraded to TiddlyWiki 5.1.5 !

I still have to dig into [[all that's new|http://tiddlywiki.com/#Release%205.1.5]], butâ€¦ check out the new [[icon-on-tags feature|$:/TagManager]] and a great case of of object lesson in [[TableOfContentsMacro Tabbed Example|http://tiddlywiki.com/#TableOfContentsMacro%20Tabbed%20Example]], all of which means SeptemberTW's  look and feel can now be improved (whilst sticking to the [[HouseRules|aboot]]). <br><br>
