As <<excerpt "I was wondering">> how to do simple text excerpts, <<excerpt "I stumbled upon">> [[this post|https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tiddlywiki/8rXt-qVqTb0/gbgWItz0CgAJ]] by [[Mat|Matias Goldman]] and was inspired to create the following macros.

!! Usage

Using the `<<excerpt>>` macro, provided by $:/.tb/macros/excerpt, define the text you wish to use as an excerpt as its first parameter, e.g.:

`<<excerpt "this is an excerpt">>`

> <<excerpt "this is an excerpt">>

At the point where you wish to output a list of excerpts, use the `<<excerpts>>` macro. For performance reasons consider specifying a filter as the first parameter.

`<<excerpts>>`

> <<excerpts>>

`<<excerpts [tag[Solutions]]>>`

> <<excerpts [tag[Solutions]]>>
