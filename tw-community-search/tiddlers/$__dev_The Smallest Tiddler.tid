Understanding the paradigm and its implications...

<<<
If we used a state field on the tiddler containing the toc then that tiddler would be modified each time a new tiddler was selected. If the tiddler containing the toc were a shadow tiddler, that would mean that the shadow value would be cloned, meaning that future upgrades wouldn't come through.

In a similar vein, an edition might want to provide a default for the selected tiddler; if we used a field then the edition would need to ship a copy of the entire tiddler containing the toc.

The question of determining the "tiddler containing the toc" is actually quite tricky. The toc might be invoked from a shared global macro; then perhaps we'd want to identify the tiddler containing that macro, not the one containing the toc.
