Add a background image to your view in your view configuration, add a few nodes, draw a few edges, be a little creative with icons and there you go:

<$tiddlymap view="Quest" ></$tiddlymap>

For recurring node types (e.g. the temples in the map above), assign [[group styles|Styling Nodes]] by using the node type manager in the [[sidebar editor|The editor menu]]. The map background can be assigned in the view configuration.

By the way, the node "Dragonland" does not open a tiddler when clicked. Instead, the map is changed to another view. You can decide which views to open in the current widget by: going to the sidebar editor→selecting a node→clicking "edit node"→opening the local-node-style tab→selecting a view.
