The startup module [[responsive.js|$:/.tb/modules/startup/responsive.js]] allows you to define in ascending order which theme to apply depending on the viewport width in the config tiddler <<source [[$:/theme/responsive]]>>

Here, the vanilla theme is applied for resolutions below 960 px, the snowwhite theme applied beyond that.

The indexes are expected as integers corresponding to the viewport width. The last index can be named freely and is applied by default when none of the previous rules applied.
