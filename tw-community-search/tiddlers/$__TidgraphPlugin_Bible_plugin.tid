!Introduction
The [[bible|$:/plugins/ihm/bible]] plugin allows you to quote scriptures from different languages and translations. However, it //does not include all the bibles or verses//. More on that later. This is how a quote looks like:

<<bqb Gen 1,1-1,2>>

You can also quote verses inline like this: <<bqi Gen 1,1>>. The tooltip showing other translations can be seen when you hover the mouse over the quote.

!How to use
!!Inline quotes
To quote inline use the ``bqi`` macro, it stands for (b)ible (q)uote (i)nline. You can use it like this:
``<<bqi Gen 1,1>>`` and it includes the verse inline: <<bqi Gen 1,1>>. The default bible translation is used (it is specified by $:/config/ihm/bible/defaultTranslation).


You can also secify the translation to use:  ``<<bqi Gen 1,1 MEX>>`` to quote from the MEX (Mexican) translation:<<bqi Gen 1,1 MEX>> 


!!Block quotes
The block version is the ``bqb`` macro. ``<<bqb Gen 1,1 VUL>>`` looks like this:

<<bqb Gen 1,1 VUL>>

or in Hebrew (install the SBL Hebrew font for a proper view)
``<<bqb Gen @1,1 BHS>>``. The `@` sign is used to show the verse numbers within the quote:

<<bqb Gen @1,1 BHS>>

or in Greek ``<<bqb Mt 1,1 NA28>>``. Notice the verse numbers are now shown, because we used `1,1` withouth the `@`:

<<bqb Mt 1,1 NA28>>
