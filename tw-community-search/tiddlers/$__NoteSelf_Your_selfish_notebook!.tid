NoteSelf is your personal, private, customizable, Evernote-like experience.
You want cloud? Fine! You don't? Fine too! It's all yours, it's your decision!
Why not be a bit selfish?


NoteSelf is the perfect place to store your ideas, notes, thoughts, tips, tricks, recipes... 
whatever you want to put into it! NoteSelf will store, index, and make it easily 
searchable so you will find it instantly whenever you need it! 


You already know and love Evernote, we know. It is comfortable, it syncs, has search capabilities...
Wow, it's almost perfect, but what about:

* Privacy - Everything is stored on Evernote's servers!
* Customization - If you don't like the interface of Evernote, there's nothing you can do

NoteSelf is built on top of TiddlyWiki, a powerful, free, highly customizable and open-source personal wiki.
We took the best of it, it's powerful customization system, and mixed it with one of the best
embedded databases available, [[PouchDb|http://www.pouchdb.com]], to bring in the synchronization capabilities you need.
