Do you have a lot of data you wish to import as tiddlers into TiddlyWiki? Here are a few simple steps to create the required import file.

To first understand how to create a valid import file, take a look at the export feature...

#open ''Advanced Search'' {{$:/core/ui/Buttons/advanced-search}} / ''Filter''
#*enter a filter like `[tag[Markup]]`
#*this lists all tiddlers tagging to [[Markup]]
#click the export button to the right of the search / filter input
#export the listed tiddlers in a format you're able to construct yourself
#*e.g. json or csv

Now, have a look at that file in either some text editor or that spreadsheet application that allows you to create such a file via text-concatenation.

Now, in order to create an importable file...

# construct your import file using a format that suits your needs
#* add the desired entries
# save it
# drag it from your desktop onto your TiddlyWiki
# hit ''import''

Now you should have imported a bunch of tiddlers from your desktop into TiddlyWiki without creating them manually within TiddlyWiki itself.
