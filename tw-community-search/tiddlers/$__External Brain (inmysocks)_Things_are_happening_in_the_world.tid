Look, a puppy:

<<textSlider "Lots of news stuff" """

Recently in oblivious American politics, [[a state senator says that mandatory church attendance on Sundays would make any sort of gun laws unnecessary|http://freethoughtblogs.com/dispatches/2015/03/27/arizona-senator-suggests-mandatory-church-attendance/]]. She claims 'any church of your choosing', so I guess that only religions that have regular worship services on Sundays actually count, because apparently freedom of religion really only means freedom to pick between different Christian sects. Or something. Yay theocracy?

In related news, Indiana has decided that discrimination is ok, as long as you are doing it because religion. [[Many people don't like this|http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-32094331]]. [[Arkansas doesn't want to fall behind in bigotry|http://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2015/03/27/religious-freedom-bill-passes-senate]].

The good news is that GenCon is probably going to leave Indiana, Yelp has decided that it will pull out of Indiana as much as possible, the city of San Fransisco has banned any non-critical business travel to Indiana for city employes (I doubt that city employees from San Fransisco go to Indiana on official business much). And [[George Takei is calling for a boycott of Indiana|https://twitter.com/GeorgeTakei/status/581141254026608640]]. Remember kids, [[it's ok to be Takei!|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRkIWB3HIEs]].

A representative of Sweden had planned to say some rather bland things about human rights when Saudi Arabia threw a temper tantrum and decided that saying 'women are people too' was meddling in internal affairs and that [['[t]he Kingdom is proud of its Islamic laws, which protects human rights, dignity and private property'|http://www.arabnews.com/saudi-arabia/news/721226]], so it must be true. Also, [[Shariah has guaranteed human rights and preserved peopleâ€™s lives, possessions, honor and dignity|http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2015/03/18/Arab-foreign-minister-denounce-Swedish-FM-s-statements-against-Saudi-Arabia.html]], as long as you are not gay, a woman, a cartoonist, a blogger or an apostate. I guess they don't count as humans?
Anyway, now Saudi Arabia has cut off most diplomatic ties with Sweden and is trying to put pressure on the rest of the world to make them apologize or something. [[Here is the speech that offended Saudi Arabia so much|http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/19230/a/255437]]. It wasn't actually given, Saudi Arabia wouldn't let that happen. So all of this is because of a speech that wasn't given and that doesn't mention Saudi Arabia.

From what I have heard this is the part that led to complaints:

<<<
Human rights are a priority in Swedish foreign policy. Freedom of association, assembly, religion and expression are not only fundamental rights and important tools in the creation of vibrant societies. They are indispensable in the fight against extremism and radicalisation. So is a vibrant civil society.

Yesterday was International Women's Day. This is a day to celebrate women's achievements, recognise challenges, and focus attention on women's rights, women's representation and their adequate resources. Our experience is that women's rights do not only benefit women, but society as a whole.

More than 20 years ago, in 1994, the International Conference on Population and Development met here in Cairo to discuss various issues, including education of women and protection of women from all forms of violence, including female genital mutilation and sexual harassment. Many of these issues are still very much in play today and I urge you to contribute to upholding the agreements made here in Cairo 20 years ago.

And so far the rest of Europe and North America hasn't said anything.

In nicer news, [[a city thought to be used as a headquarters for Boko Haram was retaken in Nigeria|http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-32087211]]. Hopefully things will go well in that fight.

And back to the 'what the fuck USA' news, [[the US has given a permit to someone allowing him to import a black rhino if he kills one|http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-32089948]]. The hunter is, of course, from Texas.

As I have said before, [[Google isn't really living up to its 'do no evil' motto|http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32083188]]. It tried, and failed, to get out of any consequences for illegally circumventing browser preferences for the purposes of advertising.

Some [[other countries are actually persecuting people involved in torture|http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-32051711]], unlike the [[US harboring|http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/11/us/politics/americans-involved-in-torture-can-be-prosecuted-abroad-analysts-say.html]] [[war criminals|http://ccrjustice.org/case-against-rumsfeld]].

Oh, and [[ebola is still a problem|http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-32083363]], there has just been almost no reporting on it in the US, the Catholic church is [[being the Catholic church|http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-32004240]] and [[Antarctic ice is still melting|http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-31965454]].

On a slightly nicer note, [[social change through comics in India|http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-30288173]].

One of these days I will probably rant about the perception of comics as all being represented by mid-90s wildcats or 1980s x-men.
