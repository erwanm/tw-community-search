* Find out more about [[TiddlyWiki|http://tiddlywiki.com/]].
* Open your saved document in Firefox and grant access to [[TiddlyFox|http://tiddlywiki.com/#TiddlyFox]].
* Proceed with step B.


!! A2. Add ToDoNow to an existing Wiki

# Back up: Make a back-up of your wiki or download a fresh copy from [[tiddlywiki.com|http://tiddlywiki.com/#Empty%20Edition]]

!! B. Set Defaults
As the main tiddler [[ToDoNow]] is part of a plugin, you can not find it using standard search. It is a so called //shadow tiddler// and you access it via links or find it via [[advanced search|$:/AdvancedSearch]].

* Set [[ToDoNow]] as default tiddler in $:/ControlPanel on the //info// tab.
** If you come from Step A1 you can remove the first and the last line in the //Default tiddlers:// field.

<<<
<$details open="no">

This means, you click the toothed wheel icon below the title of your wiki to open the options in the control panel. 

* If necessary switch to the //info// tab. 
* Here you can put a new line on top of the field "Default tiddlers:" and type the name of our main tiddler (card) there: `ToDoNow`
* Then save your wiki. 
* Reload again, the ~ToDo-List should appear and there you will find the green button with the + which starts the creation of a new task.

''Another solution'' would be to put a ''link'' to our main tiddler in any other tiddler you have like this: `[[ToDoNow]]`. Save the tiddler and click the link, you should see the list.

</$details>
<<<

* Define your language in $:/plugins/telmiger/lib/language – choose one of the following endings: 

<<<
<ul>
<$list filter="""[prefix[$:/plugins/telmiger/lib/languages/]removeprefix[$:/plugins/telmiger/lib/languages/]]""" variable=code>
<li><<code>></li>
</$list>
</ul>
<<<

!! C. Reload and test

!! D. Further Options

* Adapt the [[ToDo Item]] template which is used for new tasks to your needs.
* Maybe change titles on ToDoNow, ToDo and ToDoDone.
** This makes them normal tiddlers – you can find them via normal search. Just delete your new tiddler(s) to return to the original.
