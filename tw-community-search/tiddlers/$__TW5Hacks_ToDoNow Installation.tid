!! B. Set Defaults
As the main tiddler [[ToDoNow]] is part of a plugin, you can not find it using standard search. It is a so called //shadow tiddler// and you access it via links or find it via [[advanced search|$:/AdvancedSearch]].

* Set [[ToDoNow]] as default tiddler in $:/ControlPanel on the //info// tab.
** If you come from Step A1 you can remove the first and the last line in the //Default tiddlers:// field.

<$details open="no">

This means, you click the toothed wheel icon below the title of your wiki to open the options in the control panel. 

* If necessary switch to the //info// tab. 
* Here you can put a new line on top of the field "Default tiddlers:" and type the name of our main tiddler (card) there: `ToDoNow`
* Then save your wiki. 
* Reload again, the ~ToDo-List should appear and there you will find the green button with the + which starts the creation of a new task.

''Another solution'' would be to put a ''link'' to our main tiddler in any other tiddler you have like this: `[[ToDoNow]]`. Save the tiddler and click the link, you should see the list.

!! C. Reload and test
Visit the pluginâ€™s //configuration// tab to set

* the priotity levels you want to use
* the interface language
* the text for the [[ToDo Item]] template which is used for new tasks.

!! D. Further Options
Maybe change some texts in ToDoNow, ToDo and ToDoDone.

* This makes them normal tiddlers which can be found via normal search. 
* In order to return to the original you can always delete your personal version.
