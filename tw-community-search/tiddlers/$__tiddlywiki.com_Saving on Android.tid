The Tiddloid or Tiddloid Lite app for Android devices makes it possible to edit and save changes to TiddlyWiki. Get it from GitHub: [[Tiddloid|https://github.com/donmor/Tiddloid]] [[Tiddloid Lite|https://github.com/donmor/TiddloidLite]].

''Instructions for use:''

* ''Creating new Wiki''
** Open Tiddloid or Toddloid Lite and use ''Toolbar or Menu/New Wiki'' option. Choose a destination file path and a new TiddlyWiki5 document will be created and opened.
* ''Importing existing Wiki''
** Open Tiddloid or Toddloid Lite and use ''Toolbar or Menu/Import a file'' option. Choose an existing wiki file and it will be imported and opened.
* ''Opening''
** You can reopen a wiki created or imported above by clicking its title in the app.
* ''Saving''
** Try making some changes and click the {{$:/core/images/save-button}} ''save changes'' button. The wiki will be saved, and a confirmation message should appear at the top right of the window.
** The wiki will also be saved when clicking the {{$:/core/images/done-button}} ''ok'' button in a tiddler.

''Note:''

*  Tiddloid Lite supports new devices better. It also supports files on clouds like GDrive and ~OneDrive, while Tiddloid keeps the compatibility to TiddlyWikiClassic. For more difference between Tiddloid and  Tiddloid Lite, please visit [[Tiddloid's homepage|https://github.com/donmor/Tiddloid]].
