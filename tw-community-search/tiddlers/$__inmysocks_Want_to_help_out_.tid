If you happen to know ~JavaScript, or want to help create documentation or have ideas for improvements to [[tiddlywiki.com|http://tiddlywiki.com]] you can check out the [[TiddlyWiki GitHub page|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5]].

If you are feeling ambitious, you can create your own site on [[TiddlySpot|http://tiddlyspot.com]] ([[instructions|http://tiddlywiki.com/#Saving%20on%20TiddlySpot]]).

If you are feeling less ambitious but you have something neat to show off you can [[post to the google group|https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tiddlywiki]], or you can contact me to get it put up on this site (you will get full credit of course) through the [[feedback form|User Feedback]] on this site or go over to [[my other page|http://ooktech.com/jed/externalbrain/#Me]] which has various methods of contacting me.

If you like the things I do and want me to show some appreciation, leave some feedback somewhere, I like hearing that people are actually using this stuff. 

You can also donate to the 'help jed eat and pay rent' fund using paypal or bitcoin (<<fa fa-bitcoin>>) on my other site [[here|http://ooktech.com/jed/externalbrain/#Donate]] (this goes to me specifically, not to ~TiddlyWiki development in general, although it will help me spend more time contributing to ~TiddlyWiki development. Also, in case it wasn't obvious from context, [[I am jed|About Me]]).
