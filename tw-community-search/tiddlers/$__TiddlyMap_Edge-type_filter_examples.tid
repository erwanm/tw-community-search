You will find more examples scattered across the page but here are some examples. Make sure you understood [[TiddlyWiki filters]].

! Only show edges containing the letter "is"

Just use a [[regexp filter|http://tiddlywiki.com/#regexp%20Operator]]:

```
+[regexp[.*is.*]]
```

! Hide all tag- and link-edges

Say you want to hide all edges based on tags and links in a certain [[view|Views]]. In this case, you need to open the view and in the menu select "edit filters". Then change the edge-type filter into the following:

```
-[[tw-list:tags]]
-[[tw-body:link]]
```

Read more about [[tw-list]] and [[tw-body]] and [[Magic Edge-Type Namespaces]].

! Hide all edge types starting with "my"

If you want to exclude all types that begin with "my", e.g. `myedge1`, `myedge2`, then use the following filter:

```
-[prefix[my]]
```

! Allow only edges types starting with "my"

On the contrary, if you want to show only types that begin with "my", e.g. `myedge1`, `myedge2`, then add the following [[prefix filter|http://tiddlywiki.com/#prefix%20Operator]]:

```
+[prefix[my]]
```

This will deselect all types except the one starting with "my". Generally, it is a good idea to "bundle" certain types by using [[Edge-type namespaces]] or common prefixes. This way, you can quickly enable or disable a whole set of edge-types that is dedicated to a certain topic.

! Show only private edges types starting with "_my"

Just like in the example above, replace your whole filter with:

```
+[prefix[_my]]
```

For an example, have a look at the "Family Tree" view's edge type filter.

! Hide all private types except those starting with "_my"

Say you want to keep all [[Private edge types]] hidden but make an exception for those prefixed with `_my`, e.g. `_mycooledge1` or `_mycooledge2`. In this case, you need to need to write the following:

```
-[prefix[_]] [prefix[_my]]
```

Alternatively, this would also work:

```
-[prefix[_]!prefix[_my]]
```

! Show only edges starting with "my" but not ending with "mo"

Combine the prefix filter with a [[suffix filter|http://tiddlywiki.com/#suffix%20Operator]].

```
+[prefix[my]!suffix[mo]]
```

Alternatively:

```
+[prefix[my]]
-[suffix[mo]]
```
