Each input title is processed in turn.

* A title that contains <<.place S>> contributes everything up to and including <<.place S>>.
* A title that doesn't contain <<.place S>> simply contributes itself to the output.

Contributions are [[dominantly appended|Dominant Append]] to the output.

The [[table-of-contents macros|Table-of-Contents Macros]] use this operator with `/` as the parameter.
