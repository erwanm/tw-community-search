!!! Simple details reveal

Hereâ€™s a simple example of showing and hiding details. No summary is provided, so the browser supplies a label.

<<wikitext-example-without-html '<$details>

! This is the revealed content
And this is some text

</$details>'>>

!!! Details with summary

When the author provides a summary, this can be used to open and close. 

<<wikitext-example-without-html '<$details summary="Open here!">

!! This is the revealed content
And this is some text

</$details>'>>

!!! Details open when loaded, transclude inner details

When the author sets the attribute open to anything else than "no" the initial display will be opened. 

<<wikitext-example-without-html '<$details summary="This should be open" open="yes">

!!! This is immediately visible
To have another details section inside a details widget it must be transcluded. Example:

{{!!widget-author}}

</$details>'>>
