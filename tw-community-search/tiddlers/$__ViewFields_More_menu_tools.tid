title: More menu tools
work_menu: Naturally, many of the standard tiddler tools make sense in the menu. But also some additional ones would be necessary or valuable

<div class="smallsvg">

|{{$:/core/images/edit-button}}|[[Edit]]|immediately triggers display of editor|
||[[> or <|]]|...actually, the edit button might only be a center icon between two hover (or click?) areas, one to display fieldeditor to left or right, i.e //covering text// or as side editor //next to the tiddler//<br>(assumes the menu is in //right// tiddler margin) |
|{{$:/core/images/fold-button}}|[[Expand/Fold]]|Show/hide region in accordion slider|
| H |[[Header]]|Toggle button to cycle between: No header, h3, h2, h1 - to set fieldname as paragraph name (default; active)|
||''[[Split]]''|split into two fields (in the same tiddler) so to make a field fulfill the [[tiddler definition|Tiddler definition]].<br>possibly ''Copy/clone''|
||[[Position]]|position in tiddler, i.e list-before/after other fields. E.g up/down arrows?<br>Ideally, in tiddler edit mode, the fields should also be listed in this sequence. I.e they whould not be forced apha sorted.|

</div>

<style>
.smallsvg svg {fill: gray; height: 16px; width:16px; }

z_footer: (merely titled "Z_..." so to make this field show last.)

Perhaps a [[New Field]] button at foot of each field.


Naturally, many of the standard tiddler //toolbar tools// make sense as tools for individual sections. But also some additional ones would be necessary or valuable

A grouping of tools is done into a "head" and a side "menu", with the head concerning tools of a more "settings" type whereas the menu tools are intended for editing and content work and tools that need to be more accessible.
