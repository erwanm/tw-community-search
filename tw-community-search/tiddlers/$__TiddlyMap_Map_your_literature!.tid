You can use TiddlyMap to organize your thesis or to keep track of what you are reading and how your literature interrelates.

Note that all icons are assigned using [[group styles|Styling Nodes]]. Group styles are simple rules that allow you to assign styles based on filters. Expressed in a simplified scheme e.g. `[tag[Literature]] â†’ Assign PDF Icon`.

You can use Font Awesome icons to do that. See also [[Tiddler Icons as part of the graph]].
