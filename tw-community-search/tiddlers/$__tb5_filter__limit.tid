This wiki implements a different ''limit'' filter than the core. In fact, this version effectively overrides the core which implements a negation for ''limit'' that is not only wrong in terms of set theory but also constrains its applicability for that reason.

The limit filter provided here both corrects the faulty negation and extends the core limit filter with an ability to define an ''offset'' in the suffix.

!! Documentation

| !purpose|returns the first (or last) ''N'' input titles, optionally with an offset ''O''|
| !input|a list of titles|
| !suffix|optionally, an offset ''O'', defaulting to `0`|
| !parameter|an integer limit ''N'', defaulting to `0`|
| !output|the first ''N'' titles from the input list|

The `limit[n]` filter outputs the first ''N'' titles from the input list. If ''N'' is negative, the last ''N'' titles are output instead. If the input list contains less than ''N'' titles, the output is the same as the input.

Using the optional suffix you can specify an offset ''O'', i.e. a number of titles removed from the start of the input. When ''O'' is negative, titles are removed from the end of the list instead. The offset ''O'' is applied before the limit ''N''.
