As explained [[here|https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tiddlywiki/Q-U87Gol31c/KUNAqN_ADQAJ]], those are two radically different modes to operate. Between the two, right now, there's really just one option I would recommend to use.

!! [[store.php|Your own TiddlySpot-like upload server]]

# ''server'' => simple
#* requires "just" php
#* very common, plenty of affordable or free options
#* nothing more to set up in terms of TiddlyWiki, at all
# ''store''
#* operates on a per wiki basis
# ''authentication''
#* simple autentication, tried and tested even with TW2 since 2008
# ''backups''
#* backs up wiki files

!! [[node.js|http://tiddlywiki.com/#ServerCommand]]

# ''server'' => pro
#* requires a node capable server
#* not so common, commercially more pricey
#* requires to manage TiddlyWiki and possibly other npm packages
# ''store''
#* operates on a per-tiddler basis
# ''authentication''
#* none? => should possibly be called "experimental"
#*use with mucho-care-o (whatever that means, must be Spanglish ;-)
# ''backups''
#* none out of the box
#* you need to figure out how to take care of that for your server

! The Third Way

What I actually do right now for [[tb5|Welcome]] is...

!! [[node.js|http://tiddlywiki.com/#TiddlyWiki%20on%20Node.js]] + standalone wiki

# ''server'' => dead-simple
#* requires just the basic, cheapest of hosting, plenty-o-free
#* [[github pages|http://pages.github.com]] is just fine for me atm
#* node and TiddlyWiki are installed on your local machine => full control
# ''store''
#* organize and edit on a per tiddler basis, but node bakes full standalone wikis
# ''authentication''
#* none needed other than basic [[FTP|https://filezilla-project.org/]], GitHub, cloud storage
#* fool-proof, most secure, never writing to any server-store via TiddlyWiki
# ''backups''
#* manage however you want, local, via GitHub, or any cloud service like [[DropBox|http://dropbox.com]], [[OneDrive|https://onedrive.live.com]], [[Google Drive|https://www.google.com/drive]], etc...

''Note:'' Unlike the other two above, this does not allow any editing over the web.<br><br>You can always edit your contents, preview changes and temporarily store them, say, in a [[trello|https://trello.com]], email yourself the entire wiki, or edit tiddlers in GitHub as we already do with documentation for TiddlyWiki (having to merge things at some point).
