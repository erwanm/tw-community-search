I want to build an HTML version of a tiddlywiki that I'm running under node, but I want to remove all the plugins that are not essential for the HTML single edition like the file system sync. How should I construct the rendertiddler command?

If you want to use the same wiki both to produce standalone HTML files and in the client-server configuration then you'll need to adopt the approach you see in the TW5 repo for the editions tw5.com and tw5.com-server.

In other words, store your content in a wiki folder whose tiddlywiki.info file just includes the plugins/themes you want when building a standalone wiki. Then create a new wiki folder for the client-server configuration. It's tiddlywiki.info file would include the plugins/themes you need for the client-server configuration, and use the "includeWikis" feature to include the content from the other standalone wiki.
