<<topiclink "00:44:50" "Nicholas Question - Other desirable linkages would be Wolfram Alpha, FRINK, General Conversions">> - Look at Wolfram Alpha - Degree of implemenation with Wolfram is based on the API - Probably easiest in TiddlyDesktop - Downloadable content is only with Pro Account - [[Wolfram Alpha|http://www.wolframalpha.com/]] - [[Frink|http://futureboy.us/fsp/frink.fsp]] - We should be able to take advantage of the API with the single TW version - Probably need to be done on the Node.js Version of TiddlyWiki or in TiddlyDesktop
<<topiclink "00:51:00" "Nicholas Mock Up of Sidebar">> Could not find the mock up from Jeremy's Email or where it was posted

<<topiclink "01:09:50" "Question by Mario about TW.Com to Nick">>  Is the Contents Tab not sufficient at TiddlyWikiDotCom? Within ~TiddlyWiki itself there doesn't seem to be a mechanism for 'learn' mode with one or more paths to follow when you are learning - Discussion of learning ~TiddlyWiki mechanism - Create the Introduction ~TiddlyWiki into a guided learning experience - Preset Path is very interesting - Tabs at top would have a preset story - Introduction - Latest - and would feel hopefully like a 'normal' website - Using a Non-Linear Tool to provide a Linear Experience with ~TiddlyWiki

<<topiclink "01:29:20" "Write a Novel - Dump it to another system">> Use ~TiddlyWiki to create the book and then dump to another system like [[TeX|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX]]
<<topiclink "01:30:09" "Zooming Interface">>  Demonstation of Zoom Interface and [[Taskgraph]] - Social Networks can be mapped in [[Mathematica|http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/]] not Wolfram Alpha
