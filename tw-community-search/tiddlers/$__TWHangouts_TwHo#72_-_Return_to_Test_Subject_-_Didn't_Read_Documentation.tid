Are we losing people long before that is the problem?
It is much easier to use TiddlyWiki on TiddlySpot
Maybe we should put TiddlySpot front and center at TW.Com, we will need to work with Daniel and Simon as TW5 is not included on the main page.
They will be making TW5 available shortly but no time frame or date has been set.

[[Eric|Eric Shulman]] Quote from last week "Own it like a document.  Use it like a website"
"""

!! We can create 2 routes for getting TW Users.
* Online - Easier
* Offline - Not as Easy

[[TiddlySpace|http://tiddlyspace.com]]
Is TiddlySpace going to be around for a while?
Someone would need to talk to [[Osmsoft|http://osmosoft.com/]] about this

There are things that need to be fixed at TiddlySpace before we can promote using TW5 there.
TiddlySpot needs TW5 added to the front page as it only promotes Tiddly Wiki Classic.
