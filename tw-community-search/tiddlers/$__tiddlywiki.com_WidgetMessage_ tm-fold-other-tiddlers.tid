The `tm-fold-other-tiddlers` message folds all tiddlers in the current story list, except the one specified in the `param` parameter. It does so by setting the text of a state tiddler to either "<<.value "show">>" or "<<.value "hide">>", according to the fold state.

|!Name |!Description |
|param|Title of the tiddler that should be ignored by the fold operation. |
|foldedStatePrefix |Prefix for the state tiddler in which the fold state is stored. |

<<.tip "The core uses a foldStatePrefix of `$:/state/folded/` to store the fold states for the default story view.">>
<<.warning "The state tiddlers title is computed as `foldStatePrefix + TiddlerTitle`. If the foldStatePrefix is not set, it will overwrite the text of the tiddler(s) itself, resulting in data loss. ">>


The `tm-fold-other-tiddlers` message is usually generated with the ButtonWidget and is handled by the surrounding NavigatorWidget.
