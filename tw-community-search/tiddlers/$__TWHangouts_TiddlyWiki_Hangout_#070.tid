	* Add-ons (plugins, tweaks, themes...) - difficult to find or (more likely) even know they exist	
	* No quality assurance of add-ons	
	* Lacking documentation	
	* The aggregated knowledge from discussions relies on 3d part system not optimized for us	
	* Little insight into what attracts new users	
	* Little insight of user needs, tw applications, behaviours etc	
	* Challenging to get tiddlyverse overview (resources, applications, options, services, people...)	
	* Demanding learning curve for customization	
	* Too few developers (I'm just assuming this is always an issue)
