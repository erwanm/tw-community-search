A <<.def filter>> is a pipeline for transforming an <<.def input>> into an <<.def output>>. Both the input and the output are [[ordered sets of titles|Title Selection]] of things like tiddlers and fields.

Filters are [[expressions|Filter Expression]] constructed from smaller building blocks, called [[runs|Filter Run]] and [[steps|Filter Step]], each of which also transforms an input to an output.

A filter starts with an empty output. Its runs are processed from left to right, progressively modifying the output.

Here are details of the various building blocks involved:
