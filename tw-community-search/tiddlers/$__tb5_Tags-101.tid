The concept of ''tags'' is fundamental to working with TiddlyWiki, like the title of a tiddler being its unique identifier.

Tags provide a means to categorize and structure tiddlers. Sometimes they even have functional implications, like <<tw SystemTags>>. The [[TagManager|$:/TagManager]] gives you a list of all current tags and allows you to set colors and icons for them.

The most important aspect about tags is that they establish a ''parent-child-relation''. Semantically speaking, each tiddler having a tag is a child to the tag, like a book to an author, a car to an owner, or a property to an object, etc...

For answering //"How to tag this tiddler?"//, consider the answer to //"How do I relate this tiddler to other tiddlers?"//. Be clear about what's a parent, what's a child, what's content, and what's a property (field)...

; apply a tag
: for everything that is a worthy parent category
:: with likely more than one other tiddler tagging to it
:: the tag itself at some point serving as an index to quickly navigate to its children
; use links in the text
: for everything in need of mentioning and cross referencing contextually
:: not in the sense of a categorization, but as a textual reference
; make it a tag
: when too much content explodes this tiddler and begs you to extract sections into their own little tiddlers...
:: either use the {{$:/core/ui/Buttons/new-here}} ''new-here'' button to create a child tiddler, tagging to this one
:: or use internal links to refer back and forth between the tiddlers as appropriate

!! Conclusion

Use a tags to refer to a category or parent. Use ''new here'' to make it a tag, when you wish to relate to a child. Otherwise use internal links to create references.

!! Tag Filters

Some important filters for using tags...

; <<tw "FilterOperator: tag" tag>>
: `[tag[SomeTag]]`
: returns all tiddlers from the current list that have the tag specified in the operand
; <<tw "FilterOperator: tags" tags>>
: `[[SomeTiddler]tags[]]`
: returns all the tags present on the tiddlers in the current list
; <<tw "FilterOperator: tagging" tagging>>
: `[[SomeTiddler]tagging[]]`
: returns all tiddlers tagged by the tiddlers in the current list
; <<tw "FilterOperator: untagged" untagged>>
: `[untagged[]]`
: selects from the current list any tiddlers without any tags
; <a href={{filters!!url}} target="_blank">filters</a>
: {{filters!!summary}}
