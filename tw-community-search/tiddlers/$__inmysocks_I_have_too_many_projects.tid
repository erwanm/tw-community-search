I have way too many projects. You can look at [[the plans for this site and my tiddlywiki stuff|Change Log]]. I have similarly long lists of things to do with just about everything else I work on. This is on top of working on getting my phd and starting up a company. I don't like when I don't have anything to do. Also see [[Other Wikis I Have]]. Way too many projects.
