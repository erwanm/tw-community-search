As [[Rich Shumaker]] points out [[here|https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tiddlywikidev/ECnV8SzB6qE/gsrAmUm1SWwJ]], you can use a single [[store.php]] instance on your server to write to a number of file locations.

For example, you could have your own ''empty.html'' with customizations and plugins and then simply change the name of your wiki under [[ControlPanel|$:/ControlPanel]] / ''Saving'' and set ''Upload Filename'' accordingly. Then load that cloned wiki and continue to work there, saving changes to the new location.
