Just like you would usually filter a set of tiddlers in your wiki, you can use a node filter to delimit the set of nodes that should be displayed in a graph.

For example the following TiddlyWiki filter-expression adds tiddlers to the map that are tagged with `School` or possess a field named `info`.

```
[tag[School]]
[has[info]]
```

In addition to the filter described above, the filter below adds an restriction, i.e. only tiddlers whose title starts with `Teacher` are considered.

```
[tag[School]]
[has[info]]
+[prefix[Teacher]]
```
