title: Duplicate tiddlers from tiddlywiki.com now removed
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki


The aggregator process now removes tiddlers which are also found on [[tiddlywiki.com]]. This way authors can use the [[tiddlywiki.com]] content on their wiki, and it won't be indexed as "their" content. Additionally that makes the ~CommunitySearch wiki a bit faster.
