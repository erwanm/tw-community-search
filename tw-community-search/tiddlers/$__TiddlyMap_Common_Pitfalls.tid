!! Widget's closing tag

Please do not use the following shortcut to close the widget as it may cause conflicts with the visualization.

```html
<$tiddlymap />
```

Instead, use this version:

```html
<$tiddlymap></$tiddlymap>
```

It is recommended to use the ~TiddlyMap [[widget-wizard|Embedding views within tiddlers]] for the creation of the widget code.

!! Slow movements

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" /> Sometimes it happens that when moving nodes or edges in a graph, it seems to be a bit slow or stagnant when it usually runs smooth. If this happens, despite the graph being not big in size, it always helps to do a click outside the canvas (on an empty spot in the browser). This is a [[known chrome bug|https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=507863]]. It usually occurs after closing a TiddlyWiki modal.

!! Performance

Generally speaking, the graph-visualization runs most smoothly in Google Chrome. However, starting from version 38.1, Firefox uses hardware acceleration, which significantly increases performance, making the graph operations as fast as in chrome.

!! Color values for nodes

Do __not__ use css color names (like "red" or "darkcyan" etc.) for //node// coloring, this might cause problems when calculating the node's contrast color in the graph. Instead use the hexadecimal notation (e.g. "#FFFFFF" for "white").
