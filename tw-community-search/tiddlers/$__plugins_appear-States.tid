The appear widget simplifies <<x StateMechanism "state handling">> for you, by default not even requiring you to specify a state at all. In that case, a state is automatically qualified for you using the <<x "qualify Macro">> algorithm and a few extra bits extracted from the attributes.

What's more, you do not need to know anything about how to correctly match the different state attributes of the underlying <<x ButtonWidget>> or <<x RevealWidget>>, i.e. no "popup" attribute" for you to specify. All you need to declare is the state you wish to use and the type with which you wish it displayed.

If the automatically qualified state should not be good enough to create a unique state, you can use the ''$state'' attribute to simply append a unique string to the qualified state already calculated for you.

Last but not least, should you ever wish full control over the eventual state tiddler, simply use the ''state'' attribute as usual.

Unless you change the [[default-state|appear-Defaults]], as you can see in the [[defaults|appear-Defaults]], all state tiddlers are by default put under `$:/temp/` and are thus not persisted.

@@.note
''Note:'' Except for `type="popup"`, the state value is set to the current tiddler title, which eventually is what makes accordion style menus work, see [[examples|appear-Examples]].

!! Handler States

Should you render inner reveals at remote locations away from the document flow, the corresponding handler state is managed at a tiddler under the namespace `$:/temp/appear-handlers/`.

For an example, <$appear show="click me" mode="inline" type="popup" handler="popups">
This popup content is actually handled by:<br>
[[$:/.tb/ui/PageTemplate/popups]]</$appear>:

Here is the handler state for the widget that does `handle="popups"`:<br>
{{{ [prefix[$:/temp/appear-handlers/]] }}}

@@.note
''Technical Note:'' It contains the full parse tree for the inner reveal of each appear widget that specifies `handler="popups"`, thus rendered into the appear widget specifying `handle="popups"`, e.g. [[$:/.tb/ui/PageTemplate/popups]].

!! Currently Saved States

You will find all current appear-widget state tiddlers in this wiki listed below after you played with the [[Examples|appear-Examples]] or <$appear once show="click me" mode="inline">now there's a state tiddler for you</$appear>:
