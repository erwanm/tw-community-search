When you want to use your wiki as a public website, you may want to use TiddlyMap to visualize your content structure like with the sidebar map editor, but in a more presentational, read only way.

!! What it does

Enabling the live tab feature will add a tab named "Live" in the sidebar containing a map that opens different views depending on tiddler currently focussed in the story river.

* If the focussed tiddler has a field `tmap.open-view` with a valid view name as field value, then this view is shown.
* Otherwise, a fallback view is used that may be defined by the user beforehand in the TiddlyMap configuration. If no fallback view has been defined, the [[Live view]] is used.

!! How to enable this feature?

Open the TiddlyMap configuration and activate the live tab feature.

!! Tips

* Configure TiddlyWiki to always show the "Live" tab at startup in your [[TiddlyWiki control panel]].
