Are there any restrictions on what I can spend the grant on?
The only restriction is that it has to be spent specifically on your activities during the programme. We anticipate that youâ€™ll be using some of it to support yourself through until June, but also to purchase additional tools and materials, specialist consultancy (a kick-ass graphic designer for example), and travel to visit creative experts at other labs and workshops internationally.
