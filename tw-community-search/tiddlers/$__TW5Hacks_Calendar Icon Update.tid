Feedback from Josiah: The CALENDAR hexagon looks a bit heavy. Why not just a Calendar icon without the black hexagon surrounding it? 

[ ] Replace icon with stopwatch?
[x] Calendar icon looks less heavy

At the moment I will work with the original hexagon shaped icon from the datePicker plugin: http://kixam.github.io/TW5-datePicker/ – I just made it a bit less black.

Maybe I will replace it with my stopwatch icon that comes with the TW core in TW 5.1.14 later.
