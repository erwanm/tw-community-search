You can create a simple tiddler that has fields, code, tags, anything you want to use over again. See StandardNoteTemplate as an example. 

Then, use the code below to make a button to easily make tiddlers from your new templage.

```
<$button message="tw-new-tiddler"  param="StandardNoteTemplate">New standard note</$button>
```
NOTE: As of [[5.0.16|http://tiddlywiki.com/#Release%205.0.16-beta]] the syntax changed.

```
<$button message="tm-new-tiddler"  param="StandardNoteTemplate">New standard note</$button>
```
I put a couple buttons in the sidebar by editing: [[$:/core/ui/SideBarLists]]
