When ~TiddlyWiki generates a list of the tiddlers that have a particular tag (e.g. the dropdown list of a tag pill), it orders the tiddlers using the following rules:

# Start with any that are [[declared|Title List]] in the <<.field list>> field of the tag tiddler, in the order given there.

# In each remaining tiddler <<.place T>>, look for a <<.field list-before>> field. If this has a tiddler title as its value, place <<.place T>> just <<.em before>> that one.
#* As a special case, if the field exists but its value is empty, place <<.place T>> at the very start of the list.

# In each remaining tiddler <<.place T>>, look for a <<.field list-after>> field. If this has a tiddler title as its value, place tiddler <<.place T>> just <<.em after>> that one.

# If any tiddlers still remain, place them at the end of the list. <!-- in alphabetical order if #1378 is accepted; then also update Tagging -->
