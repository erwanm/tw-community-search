In the editor, you can select another view using the dropdown selection in the menu bar.

However, you can also define that a click on a node changes the widget to display another view.

# Open the sidebar editor
# Select a node
# Click on the button "Edit node" that is now displayed in the toolbar.
# In the dialog that opens, click on the tab named "local node-style"
# Go to the option "Open view" and specify which view to open next time when the node is clicked
