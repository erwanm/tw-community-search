Once a view is created, you may generate the widget code by opening the [[view menu|The editor menu]] of the map editor and clicking on the "Grab widget code" button.

<$button message="tmap:tm-generate-widget">
  {{$:/core/images/permalink-button}} Grab widget code
</$button>

Have a look at the many examples provided at this demo site to see how an embedded graph looks like.
