An ''Article Tiddler'' lets you present multiple tiddlers as a unit. Individual tiddlers therein are analogous to //paragraphs// in an article.


*''Preserve narrative'' - @@color:crimson;font-style:italic;Big deal!@@ Keep the //context// by creating paragraph tiddlers directly at their correct position in the article tiddler. <<stretch "Explanation >"
"""
<br>Normal 'tiddlerization' of information //looses// the narrative, i.e the natural //sequence// that information is presented in at, say, a lecture. In TW we primarily ''post''-organize tiddlers, e.g by //categorizing// or //filtering//, but this does not easily restore a desired //narrative//. But //exact sequence// of content is crucial in many cases, e.g; 

<ul><li>articles, papers, essays, presentational webpages, lecture notes, text annotations, trains-of-thought, stories, etc</li></ul>
In an //article tiddler// the order is preserved by creating the //paragraph tiddlers// directly at the correct position ([[Help]]), where they stay unless you change their position<br>.
""">>

*''Unit handling'' - The full article is managed as one tiddler. <<stretch "Examples >" """
<br><ul><li>Open/close an article with all its paragraph tiddlers as one unit, mid-story river.</li><li>...still, transclusion of an article or a paragraph gets only that tiddlers immediate text content, i.e not its contained paragraphs.</li><li>The sidebar only lists the article titles, not the contained paragraphs.</li><li>...unless a paragraph tiddler is opened separately, of course</li></ul><br>""">>
*''...yet //power oÂ´ tiddly//'' - //Articles// and //paragraphs// are regular tiddlers to re-use, slice and dice.


!!!Demos
*[[GenericArticle]] - boring, explanatory demo
*[[Beyond Terminator]] - fun, realistic demo

!!!Note
The demo paragraphs are //displayed// as "flat-linear", suitable for article-like applications. But by just changing the paragraph //display//, completely <<stretch "different applications" "are possible." """<span>

*''nested + indented'' for discussion threads/forums
**(this is actually why I'm bringing forth this whole concept now; I think a general solution would be useful for my current main concern; TWederation and adding of comments/discussions on other peoples tiddlers.) 
*as ''tabs''... perhaps useful for multiple "versions" of a tiddlers text
**(see [[Versioning|http://versioning.tiddlyspot.com/]] for basic concept)
