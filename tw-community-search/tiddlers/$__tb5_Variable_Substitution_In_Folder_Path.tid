As [[Jed Carty]] explains in [[this port|https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tiddlywiki/UWtxdIMTf9w/tHt7V-olXJ0J]], here's an answer to an often asked question: How to you insert variable text in wiki markup? The answer is: with a macro.

The below creates a link to a local folder depending on a folder name stored at a tiddler field called ''folder''.

```
\define linkFolder()
[[related folder|file:///D:/Project-Foo/$(folder)$]]
\end

<$set name=folder value={{!!folder}}>
<<linkFolder>>
</$set>
```

''Note:'' The above only works in TiddlyWiki loaded from your local filesystem.

The next example simply takes the tiddler title as the folder name...

```
\define linkFolder()
[[related folder|file:///D:/Project-Foo/$(currentTiddler)$]]
\end

<<linkFolder>>
```
