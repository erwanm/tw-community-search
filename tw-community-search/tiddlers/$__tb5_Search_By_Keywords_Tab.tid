Inspired by a [[discussion with Mat|https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tiddlywiki/iNVgY_NdVTQ/25xJhGoCPvUJ]] on search and tags — based on the method explained at [[Custom Search Tab Exact]] — you can create a new search tab to list tiddlers with a ''keywords'' field matching the search term: [[$:/.tb/ui/SearchResults/keywords]].

It indexes both a custom `keywords` field as well as the core `tags` field. Try searching for `search` and switch to the ''Keywords'' tab in the results.

The keywords at this tiddler are listed at the very bottom using a [[Conditional ViewTemplate Section]], in this case <<source [[$:/.tb/ui/ViewTemplate/keywords]]>>

Notice how all tiddlers that are listed in the ''text'' of the tiddler [[$:/config/Hide/Keywords]] are excluded from showing the keywords, which are...

`{{$:/config/Hide/Keywords}}`

> {{$:/config/Hide/Keywords}}
