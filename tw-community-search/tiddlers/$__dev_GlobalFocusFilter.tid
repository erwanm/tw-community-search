Certain applications, e.g. GTD, would benefit a lot from an ability to dynamically set a global filter that constrains all lists to only those matching that filter, e.g. only ''status:#next'', only ''realm:-work'' or both.

Imagine a "focus" tab in the sidebar, or a corresponding button popup in the toolbar with predefined filter options which when clicked constrain all (filtered) lists to just that.

Feasible?

This would also be a way to provide more flexibility to as well hide things by default in the sense of <<git5 issues/1210>>, e.g. "Admin" pages that are only visible when one clicks a checkbox to remove ''[tag[Admin]]'' from that global "focus filter" and thus have these things listed and searchable.
