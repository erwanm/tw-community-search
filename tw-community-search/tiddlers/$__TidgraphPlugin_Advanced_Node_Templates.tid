!! Advanced templates
You can also make very advanced templates, as you can see in the graph below.

This is the line that draws the graph:

``<$tidgraph start="Virtues" nodetemplate="PotOfGold CloudTemplate GoldTemplate" />``

The templates are applied in the order specified, if the conditions match.
It uses these user defined  templates:

;PotOfGold
* simple SVG icon
* uses `_tgr_node_filter` to select one node

;GoldTemplate
*One-liner with three fields:
** uses the  `_tgr_node_class_add` field to add a CSS class to the node
** uses the `_tgr_node_level` field to apply only to levels 2 and 3
** uses the `_tgr_node_filter` field which excludes the [[Others]] node

;CloudTemplate 
* has advanced SVG inside to render a cloud with text
* uses the `_tgr_node_level` field to only apply to level 1
* uses the `_tgr_node_class` field to replace the default node class with a non-existent CSS class (in effect erasing it)

This is how the graph looks like:

<$tidgraph start="Virtues" nodetemplate="PotOfGold  CloudTemplate  GoldTemplate " />
