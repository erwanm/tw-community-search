One very fundamental aspect to TiddlyWiki is that it entirely runs on tiddlers itself. This makes for a very powerful concept where application and document merge into one and the same well structured framework.

With all the freedom of non-linearity TiddlyWiki provides, consider the following for any information, data or functional bits you wish to store in it:

!!@@color:#909; Is it content, plain and simple?@@


@@color:#909;''yes''@@<br>

Make it a general content tiddler.<br>
 &nbsp; &raquo; e.g. "A Walk In The Park"<br>
Do you already have a tiddler for it?<br>
 &nbsp;  &raquo; Perhaps update that, unless it becomes unwieldy.<br>
Does it have relations to other tiddlers?<br>
 &nbsp; &raquo; Use internal links extensively.<br>
What tags help categorize this tidbit?<br>
 &nbsp; &raquo; Tags help you navigate around and find related information quickly.<br>
Will it be a tag, i.e have "subitems"?<br>
 &nbsp; &raquo; For tags being part of a tag category, consider prefixes:<br>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &raquo; ''category:'' Action / ''tags:'' #future, #next, #active, #waiting, #done<br>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &raquo; ''category:'' Context / ''tags:'' @call, @read, @buy, @fix<br>
&nbsp; &raquo; Use these tags for actual tiddlers thus becoming grand-children to a category tiddler.<br>
Does it require certain fields for categorization or to trigger advanced functions?<br>
&nbsp; &raquo; like @@color:grey;//the summary at the top of this tiddler//@@<br>

If you need to give your tiddler some <<tw SystemTags>>, chances are you want to...<br>

@@color:#909;''no''@@<br>

Make it a <<tw SystemTiddler>>, i.e. stored under the system namespace.<br>
 &nbsp; &raquo; Meaning: it's name will start `$:/`.<br>

!!@@color:#909; If it is a system tiddler, is it a functional component?@@

@@color:#909;''yes''@@<br>

''Tip:'' Starting the system path with a special character like `_` or `.` puts it up top under ''sidebar > system''.<br>

Is it a ''macro''?<br>
 &nbsp; &raquo; Place it under an appropriate namespace:<br>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &raquo; [[$:/_macros/my-macro|$:/.tb/macros/calc]] and tag it [[$:/tags/Macro]]<br>
Is it a ''template''?<br>
 &nbsp; &raquo; Again, place it under an appropriate namespace and tag it appropriately:<br>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &raquo; [[$:/_ui/ViewTemplate/summary|$:/.tb/ui/ViewTemplate/summary-link]]<br>
 &nbsp; &raquo; I prefer to use a similar path to that of the core but starting from a different root.<br>
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &raquo; I use `$:/.tb/ui` instead of `$:/core/ui`<br>
Is it a ''stylesheet''?<br>
 &nbsp; &raquo; You guessed it:<br>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &raquo; [[$:/_styles/my-styles|$:/.tb/styles/markup]]<br>
Is it for ''configuration''?<br>
 &nbsp; &raquo; Use a config namespace:<br>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &raquo; [[$:/_config/my-config|$:/.tb/config/redirected-tb5]]<br>
Does it hold ''data'' used to build a representation?<br>
 &nbsp; &raquo; Perhaps use a data namespace:<br>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &raquo; [[$:/_data/my-special-items-list-as-json|$:/.tb/config/redirected-tb5]]<br>

@@color:#909;''no''@@<br>

Is it a <<tw StateMechanism state>>?<br>
 &nbsp; &raquo; Widgets use them to remember the state of a component, e.g. a selected tab.<br>
 &nbsp; &raquo; By default saved with TiddlyWiki and thus persisted accross sessions.<br>
 &nbsp; &raquo; Place it under the states namespace with a __unique__ name.<br>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &raquo; `$:/state/my-path/the-state`<br>
 &nbsp; &raquo; Don't want states to be saved?<br>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &raquo; Read: [[States And Temporary Tiddlers]]<br>

Is it a ''temporary tiddler''?<br>
 &nbsp; &raquo; These often handle states, too, but are __not saved__ with the wiki.<br>
 &nbsp; &raquo; Place it under the temp namespace, again with a unique name.<br>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &raquo; `$:/temp/my-path/the-temporary-state`
