; replaces
: [[1407-open-default-on-empty]]

added ''~ControlPanel'' settings => reordered ''~ControlPanel / Basics'' a bit to have ''~DefaultTiddlers'' next to ''~EmptyMessage'' but not shifting important stuff too far down.

<<<
There is the emptyMessage attribute of the list widget that could be used to display custom content in case the story river is empty. The content wouldn't be displayed as a tiddler (there'd be no toolbar buttons etc.). So, one possibility is to update the list widget for the main story river to read an empty message from $:/config/EmptyStoryMessage. We should also expose it in control panel.
