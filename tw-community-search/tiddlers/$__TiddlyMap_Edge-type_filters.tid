In analogy to [[Node filters]], edge-type filters allow you to ensure that only those edges belonging to a certain set of [[Edge types]] are displayed in the map.

Per default, a newly created map imposes no restrictions on which edges are displayed. This means all edges of any type are shown, with the exception of [[Private edge types]], which are always excluded per default.
