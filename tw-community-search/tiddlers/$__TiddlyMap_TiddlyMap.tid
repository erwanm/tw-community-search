\rules except wikilink

TiddlyMap is a TiddlyWiki plugin that turns your favourite personal note taking software in a //wiki-concept-map hybrid//! Yes, you will be able to do both: drawing maps and putting down knowledge in a wiki way.

TiddlyMap will allow you to visually link and create wiki topics in order to create //clickable graphs//.

! Motivation

The motivation behind TiddlyMap is to combine the strengths of wikis and concept maps in the realms of personal knowledge management in a single application.

Have you ever created mind- or concept maps and later wished you could turn them into a wiki because they became too complex and too hard to maintain? On the contrary, have you ever worked with a wiki and felt that it is lacking visual means to express your thoughts and to relate your content? â€“ If yes, then TiddlyMap is certainly what you are looking for.
