Edge-types are the blueprint for edge instances. can be understood as containers that hold information about 

* how edges of this type look like,
* how they are labeled,
* in which way they are stored (see [[Magic Edge-Type Namespaces]]).

Every edge necessarily belongs to an edge-type. If no edge-type is assigned to an edge during creation, then `tmap:unknown` is used as default.

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" /> An edge-type can be created in advance, even when there are no edges of that type currently present in the wiki. This is done with the help of the [[Edge-type manager]]
