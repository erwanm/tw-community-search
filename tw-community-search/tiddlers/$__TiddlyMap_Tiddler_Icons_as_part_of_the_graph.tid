In TiddlyWiki you can assign icons to your tiddlers by referencing a //locally stored// image in the tiddler's icon field. This icon appears next to the tiddler's title. These icons are also displayed in graphs.

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" /> As of v0.9 it is possible to use the ''Font Awesome'' plugin and paste the icon code into a tiddler field tmap.fa-icon: `&#xf072;` for e.g. adding the plane icon (alternatively you can just write `f072`).

For example this view shows some tiddlers that have an icon field set.
