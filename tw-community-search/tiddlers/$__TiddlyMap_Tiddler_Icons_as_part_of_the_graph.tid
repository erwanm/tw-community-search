In TiddlyWiki you can assign icons to your tiddlers by referencing a *local* image in the tiddler's icon field. This icon appears next to the tiddler's title (just like the star you see next to this tiddler's title).

Icons are also displayed in graphs. For example this view shows all tiddlers that have an icon field.

<$tiddlymap view="Tiddlers with Icons" height="250px"></$tiddlymap>

Node filter:

```
