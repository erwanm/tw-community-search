In TiddlyWiki you can assign icons to your tiddlers by referencing a //locally stored// image in the tiddler's `icon` field. This icon appears next to the tiddler's title. These icons are also displayed in graphs.

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" /> As of v0.9 it is possible to use [[Font Awesome for TiddlyWiki]] and paste the icon code (e.g. `&#xf072;` or simply `f072`) into a tiddler field `tmap.fa-icon`.

For example this view shows some tiddlers that have posses an icon.

<$tiddlymap view="Tiddlers with Icons" height="250px"></$tiddlymap>

You can also use  [[group styles|Styling Nodes]] to assign images in bulk.
