[[Mike asked|https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/tiddlywiki/2rt8B033dYk]] how he could manage to have a template work both via [[Transclusion]] as well as within [[Tabs]].

The solution to his problem is to detect and redefine the necessary variables accordingly.

In the context of the tab contents, the tiddler representing the current tab is not stored in the <<tw "currentTiddler Variable" currentTiddler>> <<tw Variables variable>> but rather in the <<tw "tabs Macro" currentTab>> variable, which makes templates behave differently, since the value of ''currentTiddler'' serves as the default for a lot of [[Widgets]] and <<tw WikiText>>.

The trick is thus to redefine ''currentTiddler'' and perhaps to still not lose a reference to the tiddler in which some tabs are contained, e.g. <<source $:/.tb/demo/Template/tabvars>>

Above, the <<tw SetWidget>> redefines the value of ''currentTiddler'' to that of ''currentTab'', should that be defined, otherwise stay as is.

Try the tabs below to see how the variables behave:

<$macrocall $name="`" text="""<<tabs "foo bar baz" "foo" "$:/state/tabs/some-tabs" template:"$:/.tb/demo/Template/tabvars">>"""/>
