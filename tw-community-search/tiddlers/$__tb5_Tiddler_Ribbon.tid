Following [[these instructions|http://codepen.io/eode9/pen/twkKm]], here's how you can show a ribbon at each tiddler using a [[Conditional ViewTemplate Section]] and some css.

; the ribbon
: [[$:/.tb/ui/ViewTemplate/ribbon]]
; the styles
: [[$:/.tb/styles/ribbon]]

For the ribbon to not show as an overlay, but cut-off, this tiddler is also tagged {{ribbon||$:/core/ui/TagTemplate}}. This tag is hidden in view-mode via [[Hide Tag Buttons]]. However, this brings the problem that popups will be cut-off (<<git5 issues/1102>>). Try clicking the above tag button.

''Note'': For small screen widths the ribbon is shown as a bottom bar.
