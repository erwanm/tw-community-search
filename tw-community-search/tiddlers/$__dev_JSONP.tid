!! Problems

!! JSONP Has Two Problems

# You are adding a script tag to the target domain
#* They can send anything back, even regular javascript (XSS attack).
#* So you really have to trust them not to do bad stuff or become hacked
# Any other webpage can add the same script-tag, and steal the data
#* so never ever use JSONP for private data

The problem is that proper authentication is impossible with JSONP.

* A user logs in on site A and then goes to site B, which loads data from A using a JSONP script tag.
** As is well and good.
* Then the user is tricked into visiting evil site C, which also uses a JSONP script tag to load data from A.
* So because the user is authenticated with A, the owner of C can now steal the users data from A.
* And that's even if the user used two factor authentication to authenticated with A.
* The problem is that JSONP is highly insecure.
* JSONP is not presentation, it's insecure data transfer.
