!!Issues

* ''Macros'' are best not side-edited because they update the system after each keypress, making the ~SideEditor loose focus
* ''Height'' -  the ~SideEditor doesn't expand to full tiddler height. I hope to find out why, but meanwhile I handle this by, above the few lines seen, inserting a new row (i.e click Enter). This pushes the whole content down, expanding ~SideEditor to full tiddler height.
* ''Flipping'' - I want a flip trigger at lower edge of the sidebar lists so that if the list is short and ~SideEditor is sticks out below it, hovering this edge would cause flip... but I can't get this to work in a satisfying way (it has to do with the z-index).
* ''Styles definitions'' are placed in the code tiddlers and it's generally not cleaned up. Still too much tweaking to be made to split out.
