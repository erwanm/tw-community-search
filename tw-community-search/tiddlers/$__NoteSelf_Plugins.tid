Plugins have just landed in NoteSelf!

How many times have you ''wanted to test a plugin'' but you didn't want to go through all the hazle of installing it?<br>
Not this task is easier than ever:

* Go to the control panel
* Click on the plugins tab
* Open the plugins library
* Click install on your favourite one
* Wait a second and refresh the page

That's all! No need to download the file, no need to complex configurations, just plug and play as promised!

,,Note: the plugin library is just a subset of the official plugin library of tiddlywiki. All the plugins there belongs to their respective authors,,
