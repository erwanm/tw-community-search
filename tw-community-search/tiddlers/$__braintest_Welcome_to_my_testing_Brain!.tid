Hello all.

This is my personal tiddlywiki file for testing.

Here I will post the tools and Macros that I develop for this awesome tool. That way, all the help the comunity gave me can came back to the comunity again.

Tested under Tiddlywiky <<version>>: [[tiddlywiki|http://www.tiddlywiky.com]]

This is only possible thanks to other community wikies with the same flavour:
