A ~TiddlyMap widget will first and foremost display the nodes that match the node filter. The "matches" together with their edges form the "original graph". In addition, you may configure ~TiddlyMap to display another set of nodes called "neighbours". 

Neighbours are all nodes that are not part of the original set of nodes ("matches") but are connected (either outgoing or incoming) to a node of the original set.

On a per-view level, you can define, how big the displayed neighbourhood shall be. The size is measured in a distance unit called "step". A step stands for the traversal of an edge (regardless of it's direction). If e.g. a neighbourhood with the distance of 3 steps is displayed it means, that all nodes that can be reached within 3 steps, starting from the original set, will be displayed.
