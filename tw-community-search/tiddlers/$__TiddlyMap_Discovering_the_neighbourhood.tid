{{This feature makes most sense in combination with the [[Live view]].||$:/me/info}}

A TiddlyMap widget will first and foremost display nodes that match the specified [[node filter|Node and edge-type filters]]. These "matches", together with their connections, form the "original graph". In addition, you may configure TiddlyMap to display another set of nodes: "neighbours". 

Neighbours are all nodes that are not part of the original set of nodes but are connected (either outgoing or incoming) to a node of the original set.

On a per-view level, you can define, how big the displayed neighbourhood shall be. The size is measured in a distance unit called "step". A step stands for the traversal of an edge (regardless of it's direction). If e.g. a neighbourhood with the distance of 3 steps is displayed it means, that all nodes that can be reached within 3 steps, starting from the original set, will be displayed.

Just open the neighbourhood drop-down in the editor bar to define the size of the displayed neighbourhood for a view.
