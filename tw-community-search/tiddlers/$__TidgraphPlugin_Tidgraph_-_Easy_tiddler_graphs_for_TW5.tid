!Introduction
The [[tidgraph|$:/plugins/ihm/tidgraph]] plugin shows tiddlers with an SVG/HTML5 diagram like the following:
<$tidgraph start="Virtues" />

It uses the tags to figure out the tree structure. It can optionally use links also. If a tiddler has a `summary` field then it is used as a tooltip. If a tiddler has a `caption` field then it is used as title for the node. There are attributes to specify each, see the [[Documentaion|$:/plugins/ihm/tidgraph/documentation]] for options. 

!Installation

!!Screenshot
This is how it looks like with 7 tiddlers tagged by the [[Virtues]] tiddler:

!!Why?
I needed a very lightweight plugin to show a mind-map like diagram of tiddlers. I also use tiddlymap, it is very nice, but it is not lightweight. I wanted no third-party libraries, and a simple one-liner to make the graph.
