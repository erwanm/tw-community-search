TiddlyWiki entirely works on [[tiddlers|Tiddlers]]. This is not only true for the content you wish to give it but also for all the bells and whistles that actually make it work.

!! System Tiddlers

To not have you overwhelmed with the abundant components that provide TiddlyWiki's features, a special <<tw "Naming%20of%20System%20Tiddlers" NameSpace>> was defined in order to hide these so-called <<tw SystemTiddlers>>, prefixed `$:/`.

: search results
: most sidebar tabs, except ''More / System'' and ''More / Shadows''

!! Shadow tiddlers

<<tw ShadowTiddlers>> are unpacked by TiddlyWiki on startup as components of plugins. They can come as <<tw SystemTiddlers>> but can also be tiddlers that are not under the `$:` namespace.

!! Embedded Media

Whenever you drag an <<tw "Images%20in%20WikiText image>> or <<tw Audio audio>> file to TiddlyWiki, it will be embedded as a tiddler with a special <<tw ContentType>>.

; hidden from
: ''Sidebar / Recent'' â€” only after you edit those tiddlers they are given a modification time-stamp and are listed here
