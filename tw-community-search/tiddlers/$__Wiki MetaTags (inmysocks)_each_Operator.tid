input="a [[selection of titles|Title Selection]]"
suffix="optionally, `list`"
parameter="the name of a [[field|TiddlerFields]], defaulting to <<.field title>>"
paramName="f"
output="a selection containing the first input title encountered for each distinct value of field <<.place f>>"
/>

Each input title is processed in turn. The value of field <<.place f>> in the corresponding tiddler is examined.

;each
:As long as the field's value has not been encountered before, the title is appended to the output.
;each:list
:The value is treated as a [[title list|Title List]]. Each title in the list considered in turn. If it has not been encountered before, it is appended to the output.

If a tiddler doesn't contain field <<.place f>>, it is treated as if the field's value was empty.
