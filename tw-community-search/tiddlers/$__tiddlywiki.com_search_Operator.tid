When used with a suffix, the <<.op search>> operator is similar to <<.olink regexp>> but less powerful.

If the suffix is omitted, a tiddler is deemed to match if all the search terms appear in the combination of its <<.field tags>>, <<.field text>> and <<.field title>> fields.

The search ignores the difference between capital and lowercase letters.
