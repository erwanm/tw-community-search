I think the question of who is the target user is an important one.

Most of the discussions I have seen on the forum and in the hangouts seem to be aiming for promoting TW to an audience with relatively low technical capability.

I think this is a mistake both in terms of maximising the audience and maximising the impact of Tiddlywiki.

I would suggest that the aim of marketing TW should be to maximise something like the following product:

```
size of audience trying TW (A) *
probability of user sticking with TW (B) *
benefit received or impact achieved by user (C)
```

Targetting a low-tech audience makes A very large, but B and C are likely to be very low.

I think a better result would be achieved by targetting a smaller, but still substantial technically capable audience, for whom B and C are much larger.

In an ideal world, you would target everyone, but with finite resources, it is better to go for the low hanging fruit.

If I were to try to promote it to people I know, I would start with my colleagues and not my Mum.
