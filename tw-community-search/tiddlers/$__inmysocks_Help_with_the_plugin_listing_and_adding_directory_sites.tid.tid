The community search is a very powerful tool, but we can make it better and improve the organization of the tiddlywiki universe by adopting some community standards. With this in mind I have [[some requests for plugin authors|http://inmysocks.tiddlyspot.com/#A%20Note%20to%20Plugin%20Authors]] to improve the community plugin listing and a suggestion about [[organizing multiple sites from the same author|http://inmysocks.tiddlyspot.com/#Using%20Directory%20Sites]] for various plugins or techniques.
