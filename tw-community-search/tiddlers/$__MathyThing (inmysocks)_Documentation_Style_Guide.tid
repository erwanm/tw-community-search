The documentation for ~TiddlyWiki tries to follow a consistent style. The aim is to ensure that documentation from different authors reads consistently.

! Tone

Tutorial documentation may address the user as "you" for clarity and immediacy. Reference documentation should use a more formal [[passive voice|http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/passive.htm]].

For example, this would be reasonable for tutorial documentation:

> You can add a new sidebar tab by creating a specially tagged tiddler

But for reference documentation this would be better:

> Tiddlers with a special tag are displayed as sidebar tabs

! Tiddler Title Policy

The following conventions govern how tiddler titles are composed:

* Use lowercase single words for tags
** e.g. [[task]], [[demo]]
* Use CamelCase for definitions and concepts
** e.g. TiddlerFields, DeveloperDocs
* Use separate words for titles that are full phrases or sentences, such as FAQ, howtos or tasks
** e.g. [[How to build a TiddlyWiki5 from individual tiddlers]]
* Where TiddlyWiki or TiddlyWiki5 is used as a qualifier at the start of the title, always use separate words
** e.g. [[TiddlyWiki on Node.js]]

! Spelling

Use [[British spellings in preference to US spellings|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences]].

! Abbreviations

We try to avoid abbreviations, but the following are acceptable:

* `e.g.` for ''for example''
* `i.e.` for ''that is to say''

Note that the periods should not be omitted from these abbreviations.

! Typographic Standards

!! Referring to Titles, Fields, Tags

* ''Titles'' of tiddlers should usually be typed as links
* ''Tag names'' should usually be typed as links
* ''Field names'' should be typed in bold: e.g. ''title'', ''tags'', ''caption''
* ''Tab names'' should be typed in bold: e.g. 

!! Headings

Initial capitalisation is preferred, where the initial letter of most words is capitalised. The exceptions are small conjunctions and prepositions like "and", "or", "the", "to", etc.
