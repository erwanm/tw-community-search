The [[railroad diagram|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_diagram]] above is created using a plugin that will form part of ~TiddlyWiki5's core starting from version 5.1.8.

This site contains the latest development version of the plugin, with arrows on the repeat arcs and a less heavy style.

The plugin now offers a dedicated content type â€“ `text/vnd.tiddlywiki.railroad`. Raw diagram notation can be stored in a tiddler of that type and transcluded into other tiddlers as required:

The notation has been extended to support several pragmas for fine-tuning the diagram's appearance.
