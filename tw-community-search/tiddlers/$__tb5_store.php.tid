As [[decribed on tiddlywiki.com|http://tiddlywiki.com/#Saving%20on%20a%20PHP%20Server]] it is easy to run TiddlyWiki as your own website while editing and saving entirely online without a need for [[an offline ftp client|https://filezilla-project.org]], using a script that enabled users for a long time to upload [[TiddlyWiki classic|http://classic.tiddlywiki.com/]] to any php-powered server.

All you need to do is...

# download [[store.php|https://code.google.com/p/bidix/source/browse/trunk/TiddlyWiki/contributors/BidiX/serversides/UploadService/store.php?r=140]]
# edit the file in a text editor, adding the desired usernames and passwords
# upload it via an [[some ftp client|https://filezilla-project.org]] or your hoster's web interface to your php-server
# open the ''Saving'' tab of TiddlyWiki's [[control panel|$:/ControlPanel]] and enter:
#; Server URL
#: http://your.domain.com/folder/store.php
#; Wiki Name
#: a valid username as specified in 2.
#; Password
#: the password for that user

Optionally, you can specify further upload settings differing from the defaults:

; Upload Filename
: the filename used to save the TiddlyWiki, default: ''index.html''
; Upload Directory
: the relative path from ''store.php'' to the directory used for saving the file
; Backup Directory
: the relative path from ''store.php'' to the directory used for backups

To provide this capability for a number of folders, simply repeat the above steps.

''Note:'' With passwords stored in plain-text, be sure to be the only one with access to it.
