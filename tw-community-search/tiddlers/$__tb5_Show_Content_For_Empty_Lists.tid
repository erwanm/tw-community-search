Ever so often it happens that a list returns no results. If you don't want to leave yourself or your visitors hanging, you can use the ''emptyValue'' of the <<tw ListWidget>> to declare content that is to be wikified when the list contains no items.

For example:

<<` """<$list filter="[[DoesntExist]is[tiddler]]" emptyMessage="//I'm sorry, but the tiddler [[DoesntExist]], well, doesn't exists.//"/>""">>

!! Empty Story

As the main story river is also generated from a <<tw ListWidget>>, hence you can define an ''emptyMessage'' for it. For this purpose, the template rendering the story provides you with a placeholder. To use it, create the tiddler $:/config/EmptyStoryMessage and enter the desired contents that will be transcluded when the story is empty.

To show [[Welcome]] when all others are closed, use <<source $:/config/EmptyStoryMessage>>
